# Experience

Since 2018, I've been actively working on personal projects and working with clients to enhance my skills.
During this time, I built two web and two python applications using technologies
such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, Kotlin, Python, Langchain and open sourced them on GitHub.

Outside of Software Engineering, I'm a passionate gamer, robotics nerd, and fitness enthusiast.

# Connect

Anyway, that's enough about me.

Check out [my bookshelf](/books) to see what I'm reading!
